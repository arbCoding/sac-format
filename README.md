# seismic

---

The purpose is to work on seismic processing in C++.

I'll start off with the stuff I'm comfortable with (SAC files, PRF calculation)
and branch out from there.

TODO:
- [ ] Read [SAC](https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual/file_format.html) file format

- [ ] Print out SAC header information to the cli

- [ ] Profit
