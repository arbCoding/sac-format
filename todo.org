** DONE Rename SacStream
It isn't a stream so it shouldn't be called one. I knew this even when I first
wrote it, but I didn't know what else to call it and figured I'd change it
later.

Maybe call it =Seismogram=, or for less typing =Trace=. Then it'd be =SAC::Trace=
which is nice.
** DONE SacStream constructor should use std::filesystem::path not std::string

** TODO New functionality :functionality:

*** Incorporate Ellipticity in geometric calculations

Tried the n-vector stuff, didn't work. Moving on for now.

*** DONE Great Circle Arc calculation

Assumes spherical earth

Use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula][Haversine]] formula to start. Later can move on to Lambert's formula for long
lines ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distance#Lambert's_formula_for_long_lines][Wikipedia]])

*** DONE Azimuth calculation
Assumes spherical earth

*** DONE Ensure NPTS updates when data1/data2 updates
This would aid the user in avoiding writing out sac-files that could then not be
read in. The issue is, let's say the user wants to include data2, I cannot
simply assume level(false) or iftype(value>1). There needs to be a mechanism
that enforces a specification change in the data2 setter.

That also means that the leven and iftype() setters need a mechanism whereby
leven must be true for iftype(>1), and if leven is false then iftype(<=1). If
leven(false) and iftype(<1), but data2 exists, clear it.
**** DONE data1 and data2 ought to have same size if data2 exists (changing one changes the other and npts)
**** DONE when npts changes, size of data1 and data2 should change
*** TODO ASCII read/write support :ascii:
**** TODO Fortran style text files.
***** TODO Read in
***** TODO Write out
*** TODO Support Big-Endian sac-files (currently only little-endian)

** DONE Refactor Trace :refactor:
*** DONE Remove boost dependency
The only reason I need boost is for boost::algorithm::trim(); to remove leading
and trailing white spaces. I feel like that is not a great reason to require
boost (which is a HUGE library)
*** DONE Getters and setters
*** DONE Store data in single-type arrays
**** DONE Use lookup table
Lookup table to keep track of where data is stored.
**** DONE Maintain only doubles of the header/footer pairs (e.g., stla/f_stla)
The only time this matters is at read/write. On read, we can read it in as a
float and immediately =static_cast<double>=. On writing, we just
=static_cast<float>= prior to writing. This will get rid of the need to deal with
simultaneously updating the double and float versions (hard to remember which is
which).
** DONE Use Enum class for lookup table, not string_view.
** TODO CI/CD GitHub workflow
