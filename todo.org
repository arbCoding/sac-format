** DONE Rename SacStream
It isn't a stream so it shouldn't be called one. I knew this even when I first
wrote it, but I didn't know what else to call it and figured I'd change it
later.

Maybe call it =Seismogram=, or for less typing =Trace=. Then it'd be =SAC::Trace=
which is nice.
** DONE SacStream constructor should use std::filesystem::path not std::string
** TODO Link paired headers
e.g., az and baz should be linked, if one is edited the other is updated
Location parameters (stla, stlo, evla, evlo) should be linked to dist and gcarc.
** DONE Testing :testing:
*** DONE Move Unit tests from PsSp :unit:
*** DONE Benchmarks :benchmark:
** DONE Refactor Trace :refactor:
*** DONE Improved functionality :functionality:
**** DONE Maintain only doubles of the header/footer pairs (e.g., stla/f_stla)
The only time this matters is at read/write. On read, we can read it in as a
float and immediately =static_cast<double>=. On writing, we just
=static_cast<float>= prior to writing. This will get rid of the need to deal with
simultaneously updating the double and float versions (hard to remember which is
which).
*** DONE Getters and setters
*** DONE Store data in single-type arrays
**** DONE Use lookup table
Lookup table to keep track of where data is stored.
** DONE Use Enum class for lookup table, not string_view.
** CI/CD GitHub workflow
** Documentation :documentation:
*** TODO Update README.org :readme:
Short and succinct
*** TODO GitHub.io website :website:
**** DONE Use [[https://olmon.gitlab.io/org-themes/readtheorg_inline/readtheorg_inline.html][ReadTheOrg Inline]] ([[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][GitHub]])
***** IDEA Add theme select and dark mode
Official maintainers are not going to implement it (keep suggesting darkreader).
That's dumb. I get that darkreader exists and I use it myself, but you cannot
simply assume everyone that wants to use dark mode will use darkreader.
**** TODO Fill in documentation
*** TODO Logging
*** TODO PDF :pdf:
This involves setting up the export settings for the website for LaTeX.
*** TODO Class diagrams :uml:
**** TODO SacStream

** DONE Make single-header!

** TODO Remove boost dependency
The only reason I need boost is for boost::algorithm::trim(); to remove leading
and trailing white spaces. I feel like that is not a great reason to require
boost (which is a HUGE library)
** TODO n-vector for distance calculations
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-vector][Wikipedia]], it has no singularities (unlike standard latitude/longitude).

[[file:~/my_git/sac-format/src/sac_format.hpp::void calc_gcarc();]]
** TODO Great Circle Arc calculation
Use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula][Haversine]] formula to start. Later can move on to Lambert's formula for long
lines ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distance#Lambert's_formula_for_long_lines][Wikipedia]])
