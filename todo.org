**** TODO Maintain only doubles of the header/footer pairs (e.g., stla/f_stla)
The only time this matters is at read/write. On read, we can read it in as a
float and immediately =static_cast<double>=. On writing, we just
=static_cast<float>= prior to writing. This will get rid of the need to deal with
simultaneously updating the double and float versions (hard to remember which is
which).

**** Add theme select and dark mode
Official maintainers are not going to implement it (keep suggesting darkreader).
That's dumb. I get that darkreader exists and I use it myself, but you cannot
simply assume everyone that wants to use dark mode will use darkreader.

** TODO Rename the namespace
=SAC= in all caps is annoying. Let's called it =arb_sac=. That way there is no need
to hold down shift or use caps-lock. That would avoid any possible namespace
collision with official SAC stuff (just in case they use the =sac= namespace).
** TODO Rename SacStream
It isn't a stream so it shouldn't be called one. I knew this even when I first
wrote it, but I didn't know what else to call it and figured I'd change it
later.

Maybe call it =Seismogram=, or for less typing =Trace=. Then it'd be =SAC::Trace=
which is nice.
** TODO SacStream constructor should use std::filesystem::path not std::string
** TODO Link paired headers
e.g., az and baz should be linked, if one is edited the other is updated
Location parameters (stla, stlo, evla, evlo) should be linked to dist and gcarc.
